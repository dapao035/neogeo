This repository hosts all of GNO files that can be used in both RK and GnoGeo emulators. The GNO file is a combination of decrypted ROMs and BIOSs. In some low-end CPUs such as F1C100S series, it can improve the loading time very significantly. If you are looking for these GNOs, you can get them from release page. Enjoy !
